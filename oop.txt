# notes
- 4 pillars of oop : abstraction (only getting the important info), encapsulation (used for data hiding/grping together all the data and actions abt the data), 
- an object is an instance of a class. a class can have any number of objects/instances
- instantiation / instantiate = creating/constructing an instance/object of a class
- constructor = special method  written inside the class used to construct the objects. allows you to create personalized objects instead of default objects
- destructor =

2 types of variables
- variables that belong to the class are called class variables, these variables belong to every object : is defined outside the constructor
- instance variables belong only to the object : are defined inside the constructor

getters = accessors
setters = mutators
