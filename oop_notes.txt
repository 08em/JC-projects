# notes
- 4 pillars of oop : 
1. abstraction (only getting the important info)
2. encapsulation (used for data hiding/grping together all the data and actions abt the data), 
3. polymorphism - when a subclass modifies a method from the parent class to add its own additional functionality
4. 

- an object is an instance of a class. a class can have any number of objects/instances
- instantiation / instantiate = creating/constructing an instance/object of a class
- constructor = special method  written inside the class used to construct the objects. allows you to create personalized objects instead of default objects
- destructor =

2 types of variables
- variables that belong to the class are called class variables, these variables belong to every object : is defined outside the constructor
- instance variables belong only to the object : are defined inside the constructor

getters = accessors
setters = mutators

> inheritance
IS A - used to establish inheritance
ex. Teacher IS A Person
    Student IS A Person
^ Teacher and Student are child classes/sub classes, Person is a parent class/super class
child classes will get all the attributes and methods of the parent class
child classes can still have their own attributes and methods independent of the parent class
child classes can modify methods from the parent class to add its own additional functionality (this is called polymorphism)

method overriding - allows one to have multiple methods w the same name but w diff no. of arguments, types of arguments, order of arguments 
ex. 
def add(a,b):
   return a + b

def add(a,b,c):
   return a + b + c

computer will check how many arguments are being passed and use that info to determine which 'add' function to use
difference between method overriding and polymorphism is 

any private attributes in the parent class cannot be accessed by the subclass w/o using getters and setters
subclass/child class can have multiple parents, hence they have multiple inheritance, however this is very complex to manage/maintain

containment/aggregation - defined when one class has reference to another class
HAS - used to establish this
ex. ClassA HAS ClassB

composition (*not in syllabus) - one class cannot exist without the other class ; life xpectancy of one class depends on the other class
- difference between composition and containment is if classA and classB can exist independently of each other 
ex. Building HAS Room ; (composition) (room cannot exist without building ; the building cannot exist if room is taken out)
    Library HAS Book ; containment (a library can exist without a book ; a book can exist without a library)
