write a pseudocode and algorithm to calculate the factorial of a number using function called fact()
which takes an input number and returns the factorial of that number


FUNCTION fact(num : INTEGER) RETURNS INTEGER
    sum = 1
    FOR index <- 1 TO num
        sum <- sum * index
    NEXT index
    RETURN sum
ENDFUNCTION

OUTPUT "enter number to find its factorial"
INPUT Number
tempSum <- fact(Number)
OUTPUT "the factorial of", Number, "is", tempSum
