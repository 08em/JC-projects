A procedure Count() will: 
1. input a value (all values will be positive integers) 
2. count the number of odd values and count the number of even values 
3. repeat from step 1 until the value input is 99 
4. output the two count values, with a suitable message. 
The value 99 must not be counted. Write an algorithm as pseudocode for the procedure Count().

PROCEDURE Count() 
    even = 0
    odd = 0
    OUTPUT "enter number"
    WHILE num <> 99 DO
    INPUT num
        IF MOD(num,2) = 0 
            THEN
                even = even + 1
            ELSE
            odd = odd + 1
        ENDIF
    ENDWHILE
    OUTPUT "there are", even, "even numbers and", odd, "odd numbers"
ENDPROCEDURE

CALL Count()
